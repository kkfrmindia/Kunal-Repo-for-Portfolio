I would describe the apartment as a very warm, personal, comfortable and homey place to stay. It’s a corner apartment with good light, lots of books and  very good energy. Plus, the beds are quite comfortable. My daughter exclaimed “Hey Dad, come lie down in this one. You’ll never want to get up!”\r\n' +

        comments: "Staying at Greta's apartment was delightful!  It's a wonderful, quirky New York apartment -- very compact, but also very comfy and accurately portrayed in the pictures.  The Murphy (fold-down) bed has a very thick memoryfoam mattress that is extremely comfortable.  Samantha (the cat) was a sweet little presence, but she kept mostly to herself so we barely saw her.  The location is great, less than a block to the 1 line, and there are several nice restaurants in the neighborhood.  Finally, Greta herself was a perfect host:  kind but not intrusive, thoughtful in her preparations for guests, and available should any problems arise (though none did).  A great airbnb experience!"

Nice building with elevator, perfect location,between Riverside Park and Central Park, a block from the subway, lot of nice restaurants all around, we had a fantastic stay!

It instantly felt like "home". The location of the apartment was great! There are multiple grocery stores, restaurants, bars, etc. within a very short walking distance. The subway stop was very conveniently located as was Central Park and Riverside Park, which are both beautiful places for an afternoon walk. I would and have recommended this listing to friends that are traveling to the city and I would stay there again without hesitation.'

The apt is clean, more spacious than expected, well stocked with anything you could possibly need, and has very comfortable beds and a first rate shower. I wastravelling with my soon-to-be 17 year old daughter so she was thrilled to have her own bedroom! This is not fancy accommodation but warm and homey and probably a good representation of how an average New Yorker lives, although I suspect not many are as organized as Greta. Much recommended!'

There is also a CVS , Walgreens, grocery and liquor store within walking distance as well. The apartment is very clean and the bed is very comfortable. Checking in and out as easy as Greta is very flexible. The apartment is very spacious with a nice kitchen and lots of room in the fridge. I hope to continue to stay here every time I visit New York!

The subway entrance close to the apartment was manned and easy to buy and top up your pass, it is the only way to travel around the city. On leaving for the airport, after both our stays we had only to wait a minute on the corner with our luggage to get a taxi to the airport. Once again Greta allowed us to arrive and leave at times that suited us with our luggage which didn't leave us stranded for hours with difficult flighttimes from Australia which was a great relief, thanks so much Greta!"

I especially love the decor and comfortable bedding. The neighborhood is safe andvery convenient with easy access to bus lines and rail.  There is also a wide variety of restaurants within walking distance.  Greta is a very attentive and responsive hostess.  You will not be disappointed with her or her wonderful home.I highly recommend!"

The apartment was spacious, clean, quiet and welcoming. Thank you for making our new York experience even better. I greatly recommend Greta's place. She even let us stay until 2pm theday of departure. Thank you\r\n" +

The location was ideal with subway station, shops and restaurants just a few minutes  walk, even an Italian restaurant next door.  Central Park only 2 blocks away. Greta is very obliging and helpful especially her flexibility with our late flights.  If weever make it back to New York would definitely love to stay at Greta's again."

Birds singing in the trees outside, comfy beds, loads of restaurants and grocery nearby. Lovely easy walks to Central Park, Riverside Park. Subway stop right on the corner. We took Lyft around due to my mom's use of a wheelchair in the streets. Drivers made good time to and from lower Manhattan via larger roads. Elevator made it easy to get to and from the 4th floor apartment, and being on the 4th floor removed us from the street a bit. "

The apartment is near of Central Park and a lot of stores and restaurants. It’s a calm local neighborhood, to live your days in the city like a real new yorker :) . The place was very clean, the shower was good and beds was confortable. The heater sistem worked very well and kept us warm always - it was very important, because the temperatures was very low during our stay there. We definetelly recomend this place to stay! '

He did above and beyond what anyone would want.  He's a man of his word and very professional.  We highly recommend for everyone to stay in all of the places he recommended.  Thank you David for a accommodating our wonderful and memorable stay in Honolulu, Hawaii.  God Bless!  Henry & Jacqui (SF, CA)"

        comments: "This is everything we expected and hoped for in a sub-$100/night condo stay in Waikiki. This definitely isn't the Ritz, and if you're looking for a luxury get-away, you're barking up the wrong tree. However, if you're like we were: first time visitors on a budget with humble taste, then this place is perfect. The location is a tiny bit removed from the touristy Beachwalk shopping area, but not so far as to preclude you from limbering up for a spirited walkover there. And by the marina, you're actually quite close to the Ala Moana mall. So, the location is good. The place itself is a modest studio setup, but perfectly adequate with a good sized bed for a couple, enough space for your luggage, and a kitchenette and bathroom that though tight, is perfectly fine. There's also cable and internet if you're lookingfor homey creature comforts. It was also fantastic to have a free parking space included, an air conditioning wall unit, and the panoramic window view was pretty cool, though you only really get a peak of the beach. Also, David was very good about staying in contact with us the day we arrived to get acclimated, and we did not have further occasion to require his services the rest of our stay, so our contact was minimal, but satisfactory ... no problem there. The minor quibbles we had were pretty thin walls, so we would often hear the murmur of the neighbors' TVs. Also, there seemed to be two elevators working the entire building, so they could take quite a while to pop up. Again though, if you're like us, your#1 priorities are spend a minimal amount of time in your room, get out to experience Hawaii, come back to a sanitary place to sleep at night, all while staying within a reasonable budget. This place fit the bill, and we would recommend it to anyone with the same priorities."

        comments: "If you're looking to spend most of your time in Hawaii outside (and not inside your room or your hotel, like with the Waikiki resort complexes) then this apartment will do the trick. It's definitely not luxurious but hasthe basics and is in a great location. It fits 2 people but more would be cramped. \n" +
          "You can hit the beach in as little as 5 mns walking or get to central Waikiki beach in 15-20 mns walking.  It's also easy to catch a bus to visit something outside Waikiki. There is a convenience store nearby, as well as severalbreakfast and restaurant options. The apartment has a small kitchen with cooking utensils but we ended up mostly eatingdinners out. \n" +
          "David was courteous and likely very knowledgeable about the area but we didn't ask him for suggestions, we ended up just using our guide book. \n" +
          'Overall if you want to experience Waikiki without spending a fortune or being pampered, this is a great option. Mahalo David!'

        comments: "Thoroughly enjoyed our stay. The condo is in a great location if you want to be in or near Waikiki and Ala Moana. It's a small studio, and not luxurious, but great if you want a functional, reasonably comfortable and very affordable base for exploring Oahu. The parking space is wonderful if you rent a car, as otherwise you're looking at an additional $15-$20 a day. The building is right on Ala Moana Blvd so it's noisy if you keep the windows open, but that's also true of many high-price Waikiki hotel rooms. Air conditioning is a bit noisy; I slept with earplugs but my boyfriend didn't need them (I'm a light sleeper and use them at home). The condo has a full size fridge, small cooktop, microwave, coffee maker, coffee press, beach chairs, some knackered beach mats, towels, pots, plates, etc.. Wifi is a plus. The bathroom appears quite recently updated, and though small is nice - great shower. \r\n" +
          '\r\n' +
          "Cons: There's no lanai and the view is very partial, but to us those were small things. Elevators were sometimes very slow and occasionally out of commission, which was a hassle and a bit concerning.\r\n" +
          '\r\n' +
          'We never actually met David. All was handled by text and email. He instructed us to get someone to let us into the building, which seemed a bit dodgy, but in the end it was no problem, and he said to call if there was any issue. Condo door was unlocked and keys were on the table.\r\n' +

        comments: "If you are looking for a home base with the basics to lay your head at night and have breakfast in and then head out for the day this fits the bill. It's close to Waikiki and the downtown area but not in the thick of things so if you're looking to avoid the 24/7 hustle and bustle then this might work for you. There is a basic kitchenette and eating area. Accessories for enjoying the sand and surf are available for use, pool, and hot tub as well, and secureparking which is a plus.\r\n" +

          "If you're looking for expansive ocean views, a room to hang out and relax in with up to date decor, and where you can easily meet and get to know people staying in the complex then this wouldn't be for you.

The unit is a little dated, but it's clean and comfortable.  David's instructions were clear and easy on getting into the unit and finding the parking.  The elevators are a bit slow and one of them was always down for service, but that's no fault of Davids, just a warning if you are in impatient person.  If you are looking for an affordable place in a very good location check this place out.  "

As a former 5-year resident of Honolulu I can attest that this building is conveniently located at the entrance of Waikiki close to the Ala Moana Shopping Center and Ala Moana Beach.  This was my very first experience ever using Airbnb so I didn't really know what to expect.  I travel to Honolulu 4 times a year and always stay in a hotel, but my cousin recommended I try Airbnb as a less expensive alternative.  I had some technical issues when I first checked into the studio getting the window A/C unit (A/C remote I believe had dead batteries) and cable TV to work (T/V HDMI input wrong) but with David conveniently living in the building, he was quick to remedy the situation.

Parking is difficult to come by in Waikiki and when available will run you at least $25 a day so this condo is a bargain.  Lockbox made for easy check-in/check-out.  Elevators in this tower are iffy but at least one of the two elevators was working during our stay so not a problem.  David was great and yes, the next time we need to visit Waikiki, we’ll book the apt. again.'

It was 5 mins from Ala Moana shopping centre and  5 mins from the beach. it was easy to walk to the Main Waikiki beach even at night. Bus 20 or the trolley was easy to access from the main road and a lot of eating places nearby. The weather was a nice 27 deg with a few showers from time to time and the Circle Island tour from Roberts or  any other tour guide was around $35  and  was worth the price. '

If you'relooking for a no frills, small but clean place to stay where you can save a few $$ by cooking and warming local meals easily in the mini kitchen and walking to the Hilton Hawaiian Village (.8 mi.) this is the place for you. Elevator was a bit slow so if you have to be somewhere on time you'll need to allow maybe 10-15 additional min. A/C worked but slow upon startup but who cares if you're enjoying the outdoors and rarely in the room? Ran into David in the lobby just before checking out--he is kind and lovely!

        comments: "We stayed for 12 days and rented a car for a week. The parking is already included which is a bonus.The location is close to Ala Moana centre, the beach and convention centre in short, you can go anywhere you want usinga bus or a trolley. The place has a comfortable bed and lots of clean towel. The only problem is the elevator because only 1 is working and most of the time it's broken. David was kind enough to help us bring down our luggages. "

        comments: "With the exception of the lift, the apartment exceeded the description in AirBnB.  The apartment is good size for two people and very clean, the linens are of good quality and ample, and the kitchen is well equipped.  Ofnote are the windows which span 18 feet to provide good natural lighting, a partial view of the marina and ocean front,and good ventilation (we never used the A/C).  We were impressed with the location – walking distance to the hotel beaches, the Fort Derussy military facilities, Ala Moana Park and Shopping Mall, public transportation, restaurants, and convenience stores.  The elevator service for the 40 story/140 unit building  is an ongoing problem, with only one ten-person lift  operating “in slow mode for  safety” or not at all if winds are high.  You'll certainly need patience when gaining access to the apartment and possibly physical endurance to negotiate the stairs (we only had to climb the stairs 3 times in 2 weeks)."

The free parking space is ina secure parking garage and is very handy due to the lack of public parking in the area. The apartment itself is basic,but provides all the necessities and is good for the price. Only downsides are the noise of the AC and the hot water a bit inconsistent at times. David was very responsive to messages and we would highly recommend him as a host. Overall a great experience and we would definitely stay here in the future.'

David was very easy to get a hold of and quick to respond to any questions we had. The apartment was clean and very functional. The elevator took time, especially at certain times during the day, but overall was not too inconvenient. We were grateful that we were able to park here too. We would recommend staying here and would like to stay again when we return "

The lift system is undergoing renovation but only once waited for about 5 minutes, the other times I waited for the usual of a building of 40 floors. The parking space is a big deal because in that region theparking is very expensive. The flat is close to restaurants and is a few minutes walk from Waikiki Beach and Ala Moana mall. If I go back to Honolulu, I intend to stay again in this flat.'

One downside would be only the single elevator in action but it wasn't a dealbreaker and an easy work around. Again, location here is key. This apartment is right in the heart of it in easy access to all the main Waikiki amenities. Parking on site was great too. Would def stay here again! Cheers. "

The mall is just down the street or you could walk there, free parking at the mall if you do drive. Down the street on Kalakaua is Luxury Row. The world’s top fashion houses—Tiffany & Co., Coach, Yves Saint Laurent, Chanel, Gucci, Tod’s, Bottega Veneta and Hugo Boss it was fun to go in the shops. Having a free parking space is a bonus. The view of the marina and ocean was beautiful. I could see boats headed out to sea and parasailers. Laundry located on the 5th floor along with the ice machine if you'reheaded out for the day a small cooler was provided. Vending machines are on the 2nd floor or you can walk to the ABC store at the corner. Bed was soft and comfortable. Air-conditioner works perfectly or you can open the window for an oceanbreeze. Great pressure in the shower and plenty of towels. If you want to eat in there is a microwave, stove and fridge. During busy times you may have to wait for the elevator, only 1 is working, but there are stairs."

I feel like with the $75 cleaning fee, they neededto do a much better job. The TV had no reception so we weren’t able to use it. The mattress was pretty hard to sleep on.

        comments: "Ana and Goncalo were very helpful and accommodating. When they were not available they put us in touch with their nephew who was equally as helpful. The flat was as described, neat and tidy. The weather was quite cold, but thankfully A&G left us with extra blankets and electric heaters to use. Location was great. Outside the flat there was a slight smell of the river/ sewage, but in all honesty it did not come into the flat, and once you go down the road it doesn't carry on. This may also have been down to the very wet weather we had while there. All in all, very happy and would definitely recommend."

Das Apartment ist charmant, die Möbel schon etwas mitgenommen, aber das passt insgesamt ins Bild von Porto und macht den Reiz aus. Die Lage ist super, genau am Duoro. Es gibtStrassenmusik bis in den späten Abend und auch morgens geht's früh los mit fröhlichen Lärm von der Flusspromenade. Nichts also für Leute, die es ruhig brauchen! Die Lage ist wirklich exklusiv und tröstet über den recht teuren Mietpreis. ImUmfeld gibt es typische Touri-Fallen, wo alles doppelt kostet, aber gleichzeitig findet man auch sehr nette kleine Bars, in der man chillig und günstig frühstücken oder generell lecker essen kann. Die Stadt ist klein genug, um sich schnellzurechtzufinden und groß genug, um immer wieder neues zu entdecken. Wir waren zu dritt (50, 25, 20 Jahre) und haben dieZeit wirklich genossen. "

There were tons of restaurants close to the apartment and it was a quick walk across the bridge to tour the Port wineries. Be forewarned; if you are looking for a very quiet location, this area may not be for you. However, if you are looking to step outside of your door and start enjoying what Porto has to offer, I recommend this location.'

        comments: 'Probably Ana&Gonzalo´s place is great for summer but definitely not in winter. The house is NOT WARMand ready for a stay in cold and humit season. There is NO HEATING in any of the rooms and living room, only bed covers(not nordic duvet) and small heaters which you have to switch off during the night. Those were not enough during our stay in January even we had sunny days! Moreover we were 5 people in the house without NO HOT WATER enough for all of us. \n' +
          'The pictures did not show the reality. Furniture was much older and WiFi signal is only available in the living room, not the rooms.\n' +
          'On the other hand, location is great if you want to stay close to the river. Although think about that all restaurants, bars and main tourist attractions are close to Train Station and Clerigos Tower which means 15-20 min uphillwalking distance from the house.'

Not that this would be particularly unreasonable but it made us feel like we were walking on egg shells in and around the house. \n' +

It really wasn't the end of the world but the shower head does not have a wall fitting meaning you had to hold it yourself if you wanted to stand underneath it."

        comments: "Ana and Goncalo were very helpful and accommodating. When they were not available they put us in touch with their nephew who was equally as helpful. The flat was as described, neat and tidy. The weather was quite cold, but thankfully A&G left us with extra blankets and electric heaters to use. Location was great. Outside the flat there was a slight smell of the river/ sewage, but in all honesty it did not come into the flat, and once you go down the road it doesn't carry on. This may also have been down to the very wet weather we had while there. All in all, very happy and would definitely recommend."

Das Apartment ist charmant, die Möbel schon etwas mitgenommen, aber das passt insgesamt ins Bild von Porto und macht den Reiz aus. Die Lage ist super, genau am Duoro. Es gibtStrassenmusik bis in den späten Abend und auch morgens geht's früh los mit fröhlichen Lärm von der Flusspromenade. Nichts also für Leute, die es ruhig brauchen! Die Lage ist wirklich exklusiv und tröstet über den recht teuren Mietpreis. ImUmfeld gibt es typische Touri-Fallen, wo alles doppelt kostet, aber gleichzeitig findet man auch sehr nette kleine Bars, in der man chillig und günstig frühstücken oder generell lecker essen kann. Die Stadt ist klein genug, um sich schnellzurechtzufinden und groß genug, um immer wieder neues zu entdecken. Wir waren zu dritt (50, 25, 20 Jahre) und haben dieZeit wirklich genossen. "

There were tons of restaurants close to the apartment and it was a quick walk across the bridge to tour the Port wineries. Be forewarned; if you are looking for a very quiet location, this area may not be for you. However, if you are looking to step outside of your door and start enjoying what Porto has to offer, I recommend this location.'

There is NO HEATING in any of the rooms and living room, only bed covers(not nordic duvet) and small heaters which you have to switch off during the night. Those were not enough during our stay in January even we had sunny days! Moreover we were 5 people in the house without NO HOT WATER enough for all of us. \n' +
          'The pictures did not show the reality. Furniture was much older and WiFi signal is only available in the living room, not the rooms.\n' +
          'On the other hand, location is great if you want to stay close to the river. Although think about that all restaurants, bars and main tourist attractions are close to Train Station and Clerigos Tower which means 15-20 min uphillwalking distance from the house.'

Not that this would be particularly unreasonable but it made us feel like we were walking on egg shells in and around the house. \n' +

It really wasn't the end of the world but the shower head does not have a wall fitting meaning you had to hold it yourself if you wanted to stand underneath it."

        comments: "Ana and Goncalo were very helpful and accommodating. When they were not available they put us in touch with their nephew who was equally as helpful. The flat was as described, neat and tidy. The weather was quite cold, but thankfully A&G left us with extra blankets and electric heaters to use. Location was great. Outside the flat there was a slight smell of the river/ sewage, but in all honesty it did not come into the flat, and once you go down the road it doesn't carry on. This may also have been down to the very wet weather we had while there. All in all, very happy and would definitely recommend."

        comments: "Ana und Gonçalo sind sehr hilfsbereite liebe Leute, die  alles tun, damit man sich wohl fühlt. Wenn es etwas zu beanstanden gab, wird das sofort problemlos erledigt. Das Apartment ist charmant, die Möbel schon etwas mitgenommen, aber das passt insgesamt ins Bild von Porto und macht den Reiz aus. Die Lage ist super, genau am Duoro. Es gibtStrassenmusik bis in den späten Abend und auch morgens geht's früh los mit fröhlichen Lärm von der Flusspromenade. Nichts also für Leute, die es ruhig brauchen! Die Lage ist wirklich exklusiv und tröstet über den recht teuren Mietpreis. ImUmfeld gibt es typische Touri-Fallen, wo alles doppelt kostet, aber gleichzeitig findet man auch sehr nette kleine Bars, in der man chillig und günstig frühstücken oder generell lecker essen kann. Die Stadt ist klein genug, um sich schnellzurechtzufinden und groß genug, um immer wieder neues zu entdecken. Wir waren zu dritt (50, 25, 20 Jahre) und haben dieZeit wirklich genossen. "

There were tons of restaurants close to the apartment and it was a quick walk across the bridge to tour the Port wineries. Be forewarned; if you are looking for a very quiet location, this area may not be for you. However, if you are looking to step outside of your door and start enjoying what Porto has to offer, I recommend this location.'

There is NO HEATING in any of the rooms and living room, only bed covers(not nordic duvet) and small heaters which you have to switch off during the night. Those were not enough during our stay in January even we had sunny days! Moreover we were 5 people in the house without NO HOT WATER enough for all of us. \n' +
          'The pictures did not show the reality. Furniture was much older and WiFi signal is only available in the living room, not the rooms.\n' +
          'On the other hand, location is great if you want to stay close to the river. Although think about that all restaurants, bars and main tourist attractions are close to Train Station and Clerigos Tower which means 15-20 min uphillwalking distance from the house.'

        comments: "Ana and Goncalo were very helpful and accommodating. When they were not available they put us in touch with their nephew who was equally as helpful. The flat was as described, neat and tidy. The weather was quite cold, but thankfully A&G left us with extra blankets and electric heaters to use. Location was great. Outside the flat there was a slight smell of the river/ sewage, but in all honesty it did not come into the flat, and once you go down the road it doesn't carry on. This may also have been down to the very wet weather we had while there. All in all, very happy and would definitely recommend."

        comments: "Ana und Gonçalo sind sehr hilfsbereite liebe Leute, die  alles tun, damit man sich wohl fühlt. Wenn es etwas zu beanstanden gab, wird das sofort problemlos erledigt. Das Apartment ist charmant, die Möbel schon etwas mitgenommen, aber das passt insgesamt ins Bild von Porto und macht den Reiz aus. Die Lage ist super, genau am Duoro. Es gibtStrassenmusik bis in den späten Abend und auch morgens geht's früh los mit fröhlichen Lärm von der Flusspromenade. Nichts also für Leute, die es ruhig brauchen! Die Lage ist wirklich exklusiv und tröstet über den recht teuren Mietpreis. ImUmfeld gibt es typische Touri-Fallen, wo alles doppelt kostet, aber gleichzeitig findet man auch sehr nette kleine Bars, in der man chillig und günstig frühstücken oder generell lecker essen kann. Die Stadt ist klein genug, um sich schnellzurechtzufinden und groß genug, um immer wieder neues zu entdecken. Wir waren zu dritt (50, 25, 20 Jahre) und haben dieZeit wirklich genossen. "

There were tons of restaurants close to the apartment and it was a quick walk across the bridge to tour the Port wineries. Be forewarned; if you are looking for a very quiet location, this area may not be for you. However, if you are looking to step outside of your door and start enjoying what Porto has to offer, I recommend this location.'

There is NO HEATING in any of the rooms and living room, only bed covers(not nordic duvet) and small heaters which you have to switch off during the night. Those were not enough during our stay in January even we had sunny days! Moreover we were 5 people in the house without NO HOT WATER enough for all of us. \n' +
          'The pictures did not show the reality. Furniture was much older and WiFi signal is only available in the living room, not the rooms.\n' +
          'On the other hand, location is great if you want to stay close to the river. Although think about that all restaurants, bars and main tourist attractions are close to Train Station and Clerigos Tower which means 15-20 min uphillwalking distance from the house.'

It really wasn't the end of the world but the shower head does not have a wall fitting meaning you had to hold it yourself if you wanted to stand underneath it."

    neighborhood_overview: "In the neighborhood of the river, you can find several restaurants as varied flavors, but without forgetting the so traditional northern food.

        comments: "Ana and Goncalo were very helpful and accommodating. When they were not available they put us in touch with their nephew who was equally as helpful. The flat was as described, neat and tidy. The weather was quite cold, but thankfully A&G left us with extra blankets and electric heaters to use. Location was great. Outside the flat there was a slight smell of the river/ sewage, but in all honesty it did not come into the flat, and once you go down the road it doesn't carry on. This may also have been down to the very wet weather we had while there. All in all, very happy and would definitely recommend."

Das Apartment ist charmant, die Möbel schon etwas mitgenommen, aber das passt insgesamt ins Bild von Porto und macht den Reiz aus. Die Lage ist super, genau am Duoro. Es gibtStrassenmusik bis in den späten Abend und auch morgens geht's früh los mit fröhlichen Lärm von der Flusspromenade. Nichts also für Leute, die es ruhig brauchen! Die Lage ist wirklich exklusiv und tröstet über den recht teuren Mietpreis. ImUmfeld gibt es typische Touri-Fallen, wo alles doppelt kostet, aber gleichzeitig findet man auch sehr nette kleine Bars, in der man chillig und günstig frühstücken oder generell lecker essen kann. Die Stadt ist klein genug, um sich schnellzurechtzufinden und groß genug, um immer wieder neues zu entdecken. Wir waren zu dritt (50, 25, 20 Jahre) und haben dieZeit wirklich genossen. "

        comments: 'Probably Ana&Gonzalo´s place is great for summer but definitely not in winter. The house is NOT WARMand ready for a stay in cold and humit season. There is NO HEATING in any of the rooms and living room, only bed covers(not nordic duvet) and small heaters which you have to switch off during the night. Those were not enough during our stay in January even we had sunny days! Moreover we were 5 people in the house without NO HOT WATER enough for all of us. \n' +
          'The pictures did not show the reality. Furniture was much older and WiFi signal is only available in the living room, not the rooms.\n' +
          'On the other hand, location is great if you want to stay close to the river. Although think about that all restaurants, bars and main tourist attractions are close to Train Station and Clerigos Tower which means 15-20 min uphillwalking distance from the house.'

        comments: "Ana and Goncalo were very helpful and accommodating. When they were not available they put us in touch with their nephew who was equally as helpful. The flat was as described, neat and tidy. The weather was quite cold, but thankfully A&G left us with extra blankets and electric heaters to use. Location was great. Outside the flat there was a slight smell of the river/ sewage, but in all honesty it did not come into the flat, and once you go down the road it doesn't carry on. This may also have been down to the very wet weather we had while there. All in all, very happy and would definitely recommend."

La ubicación de la casa es inmejorable!! la única pega fue que el soporte de la ducha estaba roto pero como eran pocos días no quisimos molestar a Ana & Gonçalo y no se lo comentamos. '

Das Apartment ist charmant, die Möbel schon etwas mitgenommen, aber das passt insgesamt ins Bild von Porto und macht den Reiz aus. Die Lage ist super, genau am Duoro. Es gibtStrassenmusik bis in den späten Abend und auch morgens geht's früh los mit fröhlichen Lärm von der Flusspromenade. Nichts also für Leute, die es ruhig brauchen! Die Lage ist wirklich exklusiv und tröstet über den recht teuren Mietpreis. ImUmfeld gibt es typische Touri-Fallen, wo alles doppelt kostet, aber gleichzeitig findet man auch sehr nette kleine Bars, in der man chillig und günstig frühstücken oder generell lecker essen kann. Die Stadt ist klein genug, um sich schnellzurechtzufinden und groß genug, um immer wieder neues zu entdecken. Wir waren zu dritt (50, 25, 20 Jahre) und haben dieZeit wirklich genossen. "

There were tons of restaurants close to the apartment and it was a quick walk across the bridge to tour the Port wineries.

However, if you are looking to step outside of your door and start enjoying what Porto has to offer, I recommend this location.'

There is NO HEATING in any of the rooms and living room, only bed covers(not nordic duvet) and small heaters which you have to switch off during the night. Those were not enough during our stay in January even we had sunny days! Moreover we were 5 people in the house without NO HOT WATER enough for all of us. \n' +
          'The pictures did not show the reality. Furniture was much older and WiFi signal is only available in the living room, not the rooms.\n' +
          'On the other hand, location is great if you want to stay close to the river. Although think about that all restaurants, bars and main tourist attractions are close to Train Station and Clerigos Tower which means 15-20 min uphillwalking distance from the house.'

Not that this would be particularly unreasonable but it made us feel like we were walking on egg shells in and around the house. \n' +

          "The hosts were aware that we were a group of six yet one of the beds was not prepared and we ran out of toilet paper well before we were due to check out despite only being there 2 nights. It really wasn't the end of the world but the shower head does not have a wall fitting meaning you had to hold it yourself if you wanted to stand underneath it."

        comments: "Ana and Goncalo were very helpful and accommodating. When they were not available they put us in touch with their nephew who was equally as helpful. The flat was as described, neat and tidy. The weather was quite cold, but thankfully A&G left us with extra blankets and electric heaters to use. Location was great. Outside the flat there was a slight smell of the river/ sewage, but in all honesty it did not come into the flat, and once you go down the road it doesn't carry on. This may also have been down to the very wet weather we had while there. All in all, very happy and would definitely recommend."

Das Apartment ist charmant, die Möbel schon etwas mitgenommen, aber das passt insgesamt ins Bild von Porto und macht den Reiz aus. Die Lage ist super, genau am Duoro. Es gibtStrassenmusik bis in den späten Abend und auch morgens geht's früh los mit fröhlichen Lärm von der Flusspromenade. Nichts also für Leute, die es ruhig brauchen! Die Lage ist wirklich exklusiv und tröstet über den recht teuren Mietpreis. ImUmfeld gibt es typische Touri-Fallen, wo alles doppelt kostet, aber gleichzeitig findet man auch sehr nette kleine Bars, in der man chillig und günstig frühstücken oder generell lecker essen kann. Die Stadt ist klein genug, um sich schnellzurechtzufinden und groß genug, um immer wieder neues zu entdecken. Wir waren zu dritt (50, 25, 20 Jahre) und haben dieZeit wirklich genossen. "

        comments: 'Probably Ana&Gonzalo´s place is great for summer but definitely not in winter. The house is NOT WARMand ready for a stay in cold and humit season. There is NO HEATING in any of the rooms and living room, only bed covers(not nordic duvet) and small heaters which you have to switch off during the night. Those were not enough during our stay in January even we had sunny days! Moreover we were 5 people in the house without NO HOT WATER enough for all of us. \n' +
          'The pictures did not show the reality. Furniture was much older and WiFi signal is only available in the living room, not the rooms.\n' +
          'On the other hand, location is great if you want to stay close to the river. Although think about that all restaurants, bars and main tourist attractions are close to Train Station and Clerigos Tower which means 15-20 min uphillwalking distance from the house.'

You do have to hold the shower wand when showering but the pressure is good. Overall I would definitely stay in the apartment again!'

Not that this would be particularly unreasonable but it made us feel like we were walking on egg shells in and around the house. \n' +

It really wasn't the end of the world but the shower head does not have a wall fitting meaning you had to hold it yourself if you wanted to stand underneath it."
